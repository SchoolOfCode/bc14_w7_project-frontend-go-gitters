# Code Master - Soc id-term project 
Our week 7 project was to build a front-end application which helps to address challenges that bootcampers face while learning remotely. We decided to create an educational app packed with quizzes, flashcards & resources to help facilitate a bootcamper's learning. 

## Demo of the app
